## Hey, I'm Naiara 🖤

I'm a software rebel from Argentina, specializing in **Flutter** and **GNOME**.
I’m not just passionate about technology—I’m on a mission to use open-source as
a weapon against oppression. I actively contribute to projects that challenge
the norm and align with my values of freedom and solidarity.

### 🔥 Current Projects  
Right now, I’m developing **Replay**, a GNOME app that empowers users to follow
content creators without being chained to proprietary platforms. I'm also diving
into **Rust** and **Lua** to expand my toolkit for building liberated tech.
