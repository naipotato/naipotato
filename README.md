## Hello, I'm Nai ðŸ’–

A 25-year-old geek and programmer from Argentina, with a passion for
technology and coding. ðŸ’»

I love exploring new programming languages and frameworks, always eager to
expand my skill set and tackle exciting challenges. As a proud GNOME user, I
value the freedom and flexibility that open-source software offers, and I
actively contribute to projects that resonate with my values. ðŸ‘£

### My Mission
I advocate for a freer, fairer, and more supportive world, where everyone has
the opportunity to thrive and contribute. I believe in the power of community,
mutual aid, and collaboration to create positive change. My work is driven by a
desire to dismantle oppressive systems and promote autonomy for all.

### What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm working at **Replay**, a GNOME app designed for following content
creators across multiple video platforms. I'm also diving into **Rust** and
**Lua**, and I love collaborating with others. If you're interested in working
together or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!

### My Projects
All my projects are hosted on my own code forge:
[code.potato.zone/naipotato](https://code.potato.zone/naipotato). You can
